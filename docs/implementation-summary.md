## Implementation Details

### Payment Flow
1. User receives notification of auction win (full or partial)
2. User views win details and proceeds to payment
3. For partial wins, user selects which nights to book
4. User is redirected to ZaloPay for payment
5. After payment, user is redirected back to confirmation page
6. Booking is created and confirmed
7. User can view booking details and contact host

### Fallback Mechanism
1. When a user declines a partial offer, the system identifies the next highest bidder
2. The next bidder receives a second chance offer with a time limit
3. If the offer expires or is declined, the system moves to the next eligible bidder
4. If no eligible bidders remain, the nights become available for regular booking

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error classification system
- Recovery strategies for different error types
- User-friendly error messages and guidance
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Fallback UI states for critical errors

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing suite
2. Integrate all components
3. Conduct final testing and validation
4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor for any issues
6. Collect user feedback for improvements
